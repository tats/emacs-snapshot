This directory contains grammar files in Bison and Wisent, used to
generate the parser data in the lisp/semantic/bovine/ and
lisp/semantic/wisent/ directories.  Currently, the parser files in
lisp/ are generated by hand, not automatically.  You can run the
parser generators with

emacs -batch -Q -l bovine-grammar.el -f bovine-make-parsers
emacs -batch -Q -l wisent-grammar.el -f wisent-make-parsers
