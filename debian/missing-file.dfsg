The file that would normally be displayed here (@FILE@) has been moved
to the emacs@MAJOR_VERSION@-common-non-dfsg package because its
license does not appear to be compatible with the Debian Free Software
Guidelines (DFSG).  Please see
/usr/share/doc/emacs@MAJOR_VERSION@-common/copyright for more
information.

Please install @FILE@ from Debian's non-free distribution if you would
like for Emacs to display the original file.
