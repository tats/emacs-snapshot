This package was debianized by Rob Browning <rlb@defaultvalue.org> on
Tue, 16 Dec 1997 00:05:45 -0600.

The original source archive is emacs-29.0.50.tar.gz, and it
can be found here for stable releases:

  ftp://ftp.gnu.org:/gnu/emacs/

and here for alpha pre-releases:

  ftp://alpha.gnu.org:/gnu/emacs/pretest/

Please see /usr/share/doc/emacs-snapshot-common/README.Debian.gz for a
description of the Debian specific differences from the upstream
version.

As mentioned there, some files (including some of the Emacs
documentation) have been removed from this package because their
licenses do not appear to satisfy the requirements of the Debian Free
Software Guidelines (DFSG).  See http://www.debian.org/social_contract.

In particular, some of the info pages are covered under the GNU Free
Documentation License (GFDL), which Debian has decided does not
satisfy the DFSG in cases where "Invariant Sections" are specified
(this includes front and back cover texts).  See this Debian General
Resolution on the topic: http://www.debian.org/vote/2006/vote_001.

Some other files have been removed because their license only allows
verbatim copying, or because there was some other question.
