This package was debianized by Rob Browning <rlb@defaultvalue.org> on
Tue, 16 Dec 1997 00:05:45 -0600.

The original source for this package can be found at:

  https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/emacs

Please see /usr/share/doc/emacs-snapshot-common/README.Debian.gz for a
description of the Debian specific differences from the upstream
version.

As mentioned there, some files (including some of the Emacs
documentation) have been removed from this package because their
licenses do not appear to satisfy the requirements of the Debian Free
Software Guidelines (DFSG).  See http://www.debian.org/social_contract.

In particular, some of the info pages are covered under the GNU Free
Documentation License (GFDL), which Debian has decided does not
satisfy the DFSG in cases where "Invariant Sections" are specified
(this includes front and back cover texts).  See this Debian General
Resolution on the topic: http://www.debian.org/vote/2006/vote_001.

Some other files have been removed because their license only allows
verbatim copying, or because there was some other question.

    (``FAQ'') may be translated into other languages, transformed into other
    formats (e.g., Texinfo, Info, WWW, WAIS), and updated with new information.

    The same conditions apply to any derivative of the FAQ as apply to the FAQ
    itself.  Every copy of the FAQ must include this notice or an approved
    translation, information on who is currently maintaining the FAQ and how to
    contact them (including their e-mail address), and information on where the

    The FAQ may be copied and redistributed under these conditions, except that
    the FAQ may not be embedded in a larger literary work unless that work
    itself allows free copying and redistribution.
