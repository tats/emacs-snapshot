This package is derived from the main Emacs packages which were
debianized by Rob Browning <rlb@defaultvalue.org> on Tue, 16 Dec 1997
00:05:45 -0600.

The original source archive is emacs-23.4.tar.gz, and it
can be found here for stable releases:

  ftp://ftp.gnu.org:/gnu/emacs/

and here for alpha pre-releases:

  ftp://alpha.gnu.org:/gnu/emacs/pretest/

Please see
/usr/share/doc/emacs23-common-non-dfsg/README.Debian.gz
for a description of the Debian specific differences from the upstream
version.

This package contains files which have been deemed unsuitable for
Debian main because their licenses do not appear to satisfy the
requirements of the Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG).  See
http://www.debian.org/social_contract.

In particular, some of the info pages included in this package are
covered under the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL), which Debian
has decided does not satisfy the DFSG in cases where "Invariant
Sections" are specified.  See this Debian General Resolution on the
topic: http://www.debian.org/vote/2006/vote_001.

Some other files are included here because their license only allows
verbatim copying, or because there was some other question regarding
their license.
