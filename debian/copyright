Comment:
  This package is derived from the main Emacs packages which were
  debianized by Rob Browning <rlb@defaultvalue.org> on Tue, 16 Dec 1997
  00:05:45 -0600.

  The original source for this package can be found at
  git://git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs.git under the
  emacs-27.1 tag.  That tag was used to create the
  Debian upstream archive (emacs-non-free_1:27.1+1.orig.tar.xz)
  after making the adjustments to comply with the DFSG detailed below.

  Please see /usr/share/doc/emacs-common-non-dfsg/README.Debian for a
  description of the Debian specific differences from the upstream
  version.

  This package contains files which have been deemed unsuitable for
  Debian main because their licenses do not appear to satisfy the
  requirements of the Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG).  See
  http://www.debian.org/social_contract.

  In particular, some of the info pages included in this package are
  covered under the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL), which Debian
  has decided does not satisfy the DFSG in cases where "Invariant
  Sections" are specified.  See this Debian General Resolution on the
  topic: http://www.debian.org/vote/2006/vote_001.

  Some other files are included here because their license only allows
  verbatim copying, or because there was some other question regarding
  their license.

  Please see the files themselves for the relevant Copyright dates.
