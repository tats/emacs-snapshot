This package was debianized by Rob Browning <rlb@defaultvalue.org> on
Tue, 16 Dec 1997 00:05:45 -0600.

This is the original source archive:

  prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu/emacs/emacs-22.0.99.tar.gz

Please see /usr/share/doc/emacs22-common/README.Debian.gz for a
description of the Debian specific differences from the upstream
version.

As mentioned there, some files (including some of the Emacs
documentation) have been removed from this package because their
licenses do not appear to satisfy the requirements of the Debian Free
Software Guidelines (DFSG).  See http://www.debian.org/social_contract.

In particular, some of the info pages are covered under the GNU Free
Documentation License (GFDL), which Debian has decided does not
satisfy the DFSG in cases where "Invariant Sections" are specified
(this includes front and back cover texts).  See this Debian General
Resolution on the topic: http://www.debian.org/vote/2006/vote_001.

Some other files have been removed because their license only allows
verbatim copying, or because there was some other question.

      This list of frequently asked questions about GNU Emacs with
      answers ("FAQ") may be translated into other languages,
      transformed into other formats (e.g. Texinfo, Info, WWW, WAIS),
      and updated with new information.

      The same conditions apply to any derivative of the FAQ as apply
      to the FAQ itself.  Every copy of the FAQ must include this
      notice or an approved translation, information on who is
      currently maintaining the FAQ and how to contact them (including
      their e-mail address), and information on where the latest
      version of the FAQ is archived (including FTP information).

      The FAQ may be copied and redistributed under these conditions,
      except that the FAQ may not be embedded in a larger literary
      work unless that work itself allows free copying and
      redistribution.
