This package is derived from the main Emacs packages which were
debianized by Rob Browning <rlb@defaultvalue.org> on Tue, 16 Dec 1997
00:05:45 -0600.

The original source for this package can be found at
git://git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs.git under the emacs-25.1 tag.
That tag was used to create the Debian upstream archive
(emacs25_25.1+1.orig.tar.bz2) after making adjustments to comply with
the DFSG (see below).

Please see
/usr/share/doc/emacs25-common-non-dfsg/README.Debian.gz
for a description of the Debian specific differences from the upstream
version.

This package contains files which have been deemed unsuitable for
Debian main because their licenses do not appear to satisfy the
requirements of the Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG).  See
http://www.debian.org/social_contract.

In particular, some of the info pages included in this package are
covered under the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL), which Debian
has decided does not satisfy the DFSG in cases where "Invariant
Sections" are specified.  See this Debian General Resolution on the
topic: http://www.debian.org/vote/2006/vote_001.

Some other files are included here because their license only allows
verbatim copying, or because there was some other question regarding
their license.
