This file details the Debian specific changes to Emacs.

* Since 24.5+1-1 the info pages have been managed by update-alternatives(1)

This allows references from either Emacs or the standalone reader to
reach the pages for the currently selected alternative.

The info files for each version are installed in
/usr/share/info/emacs-N, so you can prefer a particular version's
pages by prepending that directory to your INFOPATH, e.g.:

  INFOPATH=/usr/share/info/emacs info emacs

This variable also affects Emacs.  For example:

  INFOPATH=/usr/share/info/emacs: emacs --eval '(info "emacs")'
