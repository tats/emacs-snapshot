This file details the Debian specific changes to Emacs.

The following tags may be used in the sections below: Patch, Status,
Author, Added-by, Provided-by, and Date.  When known, Author is used
to indicate the person believed to have written the relevant code.
Provided-by may be used to indicate the person who submitted the code
to Debian, and Added-by indicates the person who actually added the
code to the Debian package.

* The Debian copy of the upstream source contains no .elc files.

  The .elc files have been removed because we always regenerate them
  and because Emacs modifies them in the source tree during the build
  process, even when using a VPATH build.  This means that a "make
  clean" can't easily return the tree to the upstream state, resulting
  in a giant Debian binary diff.  There are other solutions if this
  turns out to be a problem.  If nothing else, we can keep the current
  infrastructure and just add the .elc files to protected_files in
  debian/rules.  Removing the .elc files doesn't affect whether or not
  our source archive would match the upstream md5sum because we have
  to repackage it anyway to add leim support.

* Those who prefer the old-style scrollbars can edit debian/rules

  If you prefer the old-style, non-toolkit scrollbars, just edit
  debian/rules to add --without-toolkit-scrollbars where indicated and
  rebuild.
