  * Merge useful bits from Jerome and my orphaned emacs22 tree (which
    itself was based on Jérôme's snapshot tree) in preparation for
    upcoming emacs22 branch.  Many thanks to Jérôme.  A partial summary of
    these changes follows:

    Add debian/rules info_subdir variable.
  
    Modify desktop and menu files version.  This approach should work for
    normal versions, "Emacs 21.4a (X11)", and for snapshots, "Emacs
    2006-09-09 (X11)".  See the menu_ver variable in debian/rules.

    Overhaul debian/rules to build all of the install trees at once and
    then call the dh_* programs generically rather than calling them once
    per package. [rlb]

  * Fix invocation of wc -l when counting fns-*.el files. [rlb]

  * Use dpatch for the autotool related diff rather than generating and
    applying a diff manually.  What was the debian/autofiles.diff is now
    handled via debian/patches/autofiles.dpatch.  Also, we no longer try
    to automatically generate the diff when needed.  Instead, the diff
    must be generated manually via "debian/rules autofiles-sync".
  
    The earlier approach was broken because dpatch files that
    autofiles.diff depended on could end up later in the Debian diff (and
    hence have newer timestamps).  This would cause an unexpected run of
    aclocal, etc.  and break the buildds.  If we ever want to re-automate
    generation of the autofiles diff, we'll need to use dpatch md5 sigs
    (or similar) rather than timestamps.  (closes: #297796) [rlb]

    - debian/patches/00list: added autofiles

  * Restructure debian/rules to build -el in binary-indep
    (closes: #26761)
  * Add emacsclient.1 manpage submitted ages ago. (closes: #22463)
  * Handle duplicate DOC files (closes: #27668)
  * Switch to gnu icon from old B&W drippy sink (closes: #33260)

emacs20 (20.3-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added HURD patch from Marcus Brinkmann <brinkmd@debian.org>.
    (closes: #38571).
  * Backed out (global-set-key [delete] 'delete-char) modification 
    (Ref: #26366).  This is too controversial (think cross-platform)
    and needs to be resolved by the Debian Keyboard Czar in concert with
    others.  For now we revert to the upstream behavior...
  * Add /usr/share/info to info search path (closes: #38285).

 -- Rob Browning <rlb@cs.utexas.edu>  Fri, 11 Jun 1999 00:43:51 -0500

emacs20 (20.3-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added patch to emacs.c from Wolfram Gloger
    <wmglo@dent.med.uni-muenchen.de> to fix exit segfaults.
    (closes: #37745)
  * Fixed suidregister inconsistency between postinst and postrm
    (closes #36845)

 -- Rob Browning <rlb@cs.utexas.edu>  Sun, 30 May 1999 14:38:51 -0500

emacs20 (20.3-7) unstable frozen; urgency=low

  * Needed to go to frozen too: --print-architecture was an important
    bug.  Should be OK since other fixes since -5 are minor and
    important.
  * Add conflict with w3-el (as per Ben Pfaff's <pfaffben@pilot.msu.edu>
    request). (closes: #30413).
  * Undo broken (and unneeded) "fix" for suidregister call in postrm.

 -- Rob Browning <rlb@cs.utexas.edu>  Thu, 28 Jan 1999 14:49:27 -0600

emacs20 (20.3-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use --print-installation-architecture rather than --print-architecture
    (closes: #28177).
  * Remove "#undef SIGIO" from m/arm.h as indicated by David Welton
    <davidw@debian.org> (closes: #31279).
  * Fix call to suidunregister (I didn't realize that it can't take
    multiple file arguments) (closes: #21243 #26886).

 -- Rob Browning <rlb@cs.utexas.edu>  Wed, 27 Jan 1999 11:50:14 -0600

emacs20 (20.3-5) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Added NetWinder patches (closes: #28277).  (Thanks to David Welton)
  * Rebuilt emacs20-el so the versions coincide.  In the future, people
    need to be sure to build *both* binary packages when doing a
    non-maintainer binary release.  (This fix justifies inclusion into
    frozen).

 -- Rob Browning <rlb@cs.utexas.edu>  Sun,  1 Nov 1998 20:14:36 -0600

emacs20 (20.3-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix gnus to default to /var/spool/mail rather than /usr/spool/mail for
    mailbox locations (closes: #21364).

 -- Rob Browning <rlb@cs.utexas.edu>  Sat, 17 Oct 1998 14:28:45 -0500

emacs20 (20.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed leim.  All the input methods should work now (closes: #27398).
  * Made (global-set-key [delete] 'delete-char) the default (closes: #26366).
  * Fix ownership on emacs20-el files (closes: #27398).

 -- Rob Browning <rlb@cs.utexas.edu>  Tue, 13 Oct 1998 16:57:51 -0500

emacs20 (20.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added 20.2 patches for powerpc.  I omitted the patches to the
    following files because it looks like equivalent fixes have already
    made it into 20.3.  If anyone who understands that code better knows
    differently, please let me know.  The rest of the patches applied
    cleanly.
      src/callproc.c.rej
      src/dired.c.rej
      src/fileio.c.rej
      src/process.c.rej
      src/regex.c.rej
    I also modified src/m/powerpc.h to fix problems calling the ldscript.

emacs20 (20.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Modify all the debian/* stuff to automatically track version changes.
  * Major changes to info page handling.  Emacs20 info is now integrated into
    the main info page.  This was the best way I could think of to handle
    cross references, etc. without major source changes.
  * Locked emacs20-el and emacs20 package versions together with dependencies.
  * Add info direntries for widget, info, and customize.
  * Fix handling of /usr/local/share (which was badly broken).
  * Turn stripping back on.  It appears to work.

 -- Rob Browning <rlb@cs.utexas.edu>  Tue,  1 Sep 1998 11:44:04 -0500

emacs20 (20.2-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixes for leim problems (closes: #25536).  Thanks to
    Junio Hamano <junio@twinsun.com>
  * update-elc now made executable (closes: #25899).  Thanks to
    Junio Hamano <junio@twinsun.com>
  * Fix problem with package including dirs in /usr/local/share
    (closes: #23431).

 -- Rob Browning <rlb@cs.utexas.edu>  Sat, 22 Aug 1998 11:45:16 -0500

emacs20 (20.2-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Regenerate .elc files for .el files we've modified.  I didn't realize
    that some of the .elc files were in the upstream tar file.  Hope this
    doesn't break anything.  We haven't been using our sendmail and
    message modifications until now.  (closes: #21079).
  * Fix i386ism in debian scripts use "dpkg --print-architecture"
    instead. (closes: #20548).
  * Fixed reference in README.add-on-package-maintainers
    (closes: #23445)
  * Fix some alpha problems (closes: #21834).
  * Had to add Replaces: emacs20 to emacs20-el to fix problem with
    copyright files being in the wrong package (closes: #21531).

 -- Rob Browning <rlb@cs.utexas.edu>  Fri,  7 Aug 1998 20:39:59 -0500

emacs20 (20.2-7) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed emacs20-el from standard to optional.
  * Fixed broken postrm (release critical) (closes: #24236)
  * Don't strip emacs binary (strip is broken see binutils #23153).
  * Since we can't strip, don't compile or link with "-g".

 -- Rob Browning <rlb@cs.utexas.edu>  Thu, 16 Jul 1998 16:58:04 -0500

emacs20 (20.2-6) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Gack.  Fix reject due to changed .tar.gz file (./leim added to tar).

emacs20 (20.2-5) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Make sure to preserve timestamps on .el files in emacs20-el
    (closes: #20274)
  * Add leim support for alternate input methods.  May close several
    bugs.

emacs20 (20.2-4) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Added copright file to emacs20-el package (closes: #19300)

emacs20 (20.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

emacs20 (20.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Explicit dependency on liblockfile0 until bug is fixed
    (closes #18186)
  * added lisp/site-lisp.el to fix info path problem (closes #18190)

 -- Rob Browning <rlb@cs.utexas.edu>  Sat, 14 Feb 1998 19:19:09 -0600

emacs20 (20.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * movemail no longer suid -- not needed.
  * start from scratch with emacs-20.2 source and old emacs-19.34 and
    xemacs patches.
