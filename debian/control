Description: GNU Emacs editor (with Lucid GUI support)
 GNU Emacs is the extensible self-documenting text editor.  This
 package contains a version of Emacs with support for a graphical user
 interface based on the Lucid toolkit (instead of the GTK+ interface
 provided by the emacs26 package).  Until some known GTK+
 problems are fixed, this version may help avoid crashing Emacs during
 an emacsclient disconnect.  See
 https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=567934 and
 https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=85715 for more
 information.
