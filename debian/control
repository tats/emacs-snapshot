Description: GNU Emacs shared, architecture independent, non-DFSG items
 GNU Emacs is the extensible self-documenting text editor.  This
 package contains the architecture independent infrastructure that is
 not compliant with the Debian Free Software Guidelines.  In
 particular, this includes some of the GNU Emacs info pages, as they
 are covered under the GFDL, and they specify invariant sections.
 See http://www.debian.org/vote/2006/vote_001 for more information.
