* The build will fail if liblockfile isn't selected for movemail.
  Patch: require-movemail-use-liblockfile.diff
  Author: Rob Browning <rlb@defaultvalue.org>
  Added-by: Rob Browning <rlb@defaultvalue.org>

  This makes sure the Debian Emacs won't accidentally be built with
  the wrong locking strategy.  To disable this check, comment out
  require-movemail-use-liblockfile.diff in debian/patches/series.
