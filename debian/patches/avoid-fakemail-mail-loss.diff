Subject: avoid-fakemail-mail-loss

* An attempt is made to avoid silently losing mail via fakemail.
  Patch: avoid-fakemail-mail-loss.diff
  Author: Rob Browning <rlb@defaultvalue.org>
  Added-by: Rob Browning <rlb@defaultvalue.org>

  This fix attempts to avoid a situation where Emacs can silently lose
  mail.  This can occur if sendmail.el (at least) falls back to
  fakemail, and the underlying binary (MAIL_PROGRAM_NAME) that
  fakemail is configured to use doesn't exist.  Unless
  mail-interactive is true, Emacs won't wait for the mailer and so
  won't know that fakemail failed.

  For now, Debian sets fakemail's MAIL_PROGRAM_NAME to /usr/bin/mail
  (which is the correct value for Debian systems) rather than
  /bin/mail.  Debian also adjusts Emacs to test whether or not
  /usr/bin/mail exists and is executable.  If either of these tests
  fail, then mail-interactive is set to t.  That should ensure that a
  user will actually see an error if they attempt to use the broken
  fakemail.

  Note that Debian actually forces the MAIL_PROGRAM_NAME value to
  /usr/bin/mail.  The build will fail if any other value is specified.
  This is done to ensure that MAIL_PROGRAM_NAME isn't accidentally set
  to some other value during the build process.  If this is
  undesirable for some reason, just comment out
  avoid-fakemail-loss.diff in debian/patches/series.
