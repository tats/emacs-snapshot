* The default handling of mail from addresses has been changed.
  Patch: debian-adjust-mail-from-addresses.diff
  Bug: 7051 35128

  * The default for message-sendmail-f-is-evil has been changed to t.

    This is correct for Debian systems where we know the MTA should be
    trusted.
    
  * The default mail-from-style is 'system-default rather than 'angles.
