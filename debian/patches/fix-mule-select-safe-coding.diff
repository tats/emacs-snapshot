Subject: fix-mule-select-safe-coding

* A problem with saving non-ASCII buffers has been fixed.
  Patch: fix-mule-select-safe-coding.diff
  Provided-by: Jun Inoue <jun.lambda@gmail.com>
  Date: Sun, 29 Jun 2008 05:07:24 +0900
  Added-by: Rob Browning <rlb@defaultvalue.org>
  Status: incorporated upstream

  Previously, Emacs would raise an error if even one coding system was
  rejected when trying to save a buffer containing non-ASCII text when
  select-safe-coding-system-accept-default-p was set to a function.
  Now Emacs should continue.
