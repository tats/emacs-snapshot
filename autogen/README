This directory contains some pre-built generated files.
Most people do not need to use these files - instead you should
generate them yourself using eg `autogen.sh'.

File:        Destination:  Created by:
configure    ../           autoconf
config.in    ../src        autoheader      * also used by MSDOS bzr build
aclocal.m4   ../           aclocal
Makefile.in  ../lib        automake
compile      ../build-aux  automake
config.guess ../build-aux  automake
config.sub   ../build-aux  automake
depcomp      ../build-aux  automake
install-sh   ../build-aux  automake
missing      ../build-aux  automake

There are also some scripts:

copy_autogen    - copy pre-built generated files into place
update_autogen  - regenerate generated files (for maintainers)
