	      Building and Installing Emacs from Bazaar

If this is the first time you go through it, you'll need to configure
before bootstrapping:

  $ ./configure

Some of the files that are included in the Emacs tarball, such as
byte-compiled Lisp files, are not stored in Bazaar.  Therefore, to
build from Bazaar you must run "make bootstrap" instead of just "make":

  $ bzr pull
  $ make bootstrap

Normally, it is not necessary to use "make bootstrap" after every
update from Bazaar.  "make" should work in 90% of the cases and be
much quicker.

  $ make

(If you want to install the Emacs binary, type "make install" instead
of "make" in the last command.)

Occasionally the file "lisp/loaddefs.el" (and similar automatically
generated files, such as esh-groups.el, and *-loaddefs.el in some
subdirectories of lisp/, e.g. mh-e/ and calendar/) will need to be
updated to reflect new autoloaded functions.  If you see errors (rather
than warnings) about undefined lisp functions during compilation, that
may be the reason.  Finally, sometimes there can be build failures
related to *loaddefs.el (e.g. "required feature `esh-groups' was not
provided").  In that case, follow the instructions below.

To update loaddefs.el (and similar files), do:

  $ cd lisp
  $ make autoloads

If either of the above partial procedures fails, try "make bootstrap".
If CPU time is not an issue, the most thorough way to rebuild, and
avoid any spurious problems, is always to use this method.

Users of non-Posix systems (MS-Windows etc.) should run the
platform-specific configuration scripts (nt/configure.bat, config.bat,
etc.) before "make bootstrap" or "make"; the rest of the procedure is
applicable to those systems as well.

Because the Bazaar version of Emacs is a work in progress, it will
sometimes fail to build.  Please wait a day or so (and check the bug
and development mailing list archives) before reporting such problems.
In most cases, the problem is known about and is just waiting for
someone to fix it.
